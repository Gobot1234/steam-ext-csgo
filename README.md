# steam-ext-csgo

An extension to interact with the CS-GO Game Coordinator for 
[steam.py](https://github.com/Gobot1234/steam.py). `csgo.Client` and `csgo.Bot` are `steam.Client` and `commands.Bot` 
subclasses respectively, so whatever you can do with `steam`/`ext.commands` you can do with `ext.csgo`
