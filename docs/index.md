# Welcome to steam.ext.csgo's documentation

An extension to interact with the CS-GO Game Coordinator for
[steam.py](https://github.com/Gobot1234/steam.py). `csgo.Client` and `csgo.Bot` are `steam.Client` and `commands.Bot`
subclasses respectively, so whatever you can do with `steam`/`ext.commands` you can do with `ext.csgo`

## Key Features

- Modern Pythonic API using `async`/`await` syntax
- Easy to use with an object-oriented design
- Fully typed hinted for faster development
- Builds off of steam.py's pre-existing types with item handling out of the box.

## Getting help

- Ask us in our {resource}`discord <discord>` server.
- If you're looking for something specific, try the {ref}`index <genindex>` or {ref}`searching <search>`.
